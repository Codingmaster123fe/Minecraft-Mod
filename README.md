# Minecraft-Mod
EchoMod, a mod for Minecraft that features a returning magical boomerang, a glowshroom block you can toggle on and off, a cool XP level halo effect, a speed boost when walking on ice, and simple commands to bind and recall your location.

If you are wondering what the commands are for the teleporting and stuff here it is.

/bindhere — This command saves your current spot as a “recall point.” Think of it like bookmarking a place you want to return to later.

/recall — Teleports you back to the spot you saved with /bindhere. If you haven’t set a spot yet, it’ll tell you to use /bindhere first.

Hope you like it and if there are any bugs, please create a issue so i can look in to it.
